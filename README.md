My Advent of Code 2016 solutions - written in 2017, committed here retroactively.

I used Haskell for the first 8 days, just to have an opportunity to use it :), for the first (and so far also last...) time since university. Then I switched to Python for the next 8 days - very suitable, very pleasant. So to try something less convenient, I then switched to C++ - which, same as Haskell, I also didn't get to use since university. But unlike Haskell, I don't really enjoy C++, so I immediately changed plans and finished the rest of the days in Racket. That was my first (and only) time using Racket, other than working through The Little Schemer.

Code readability was the main focus. Performance was not a concern (within reasonable bounds).
